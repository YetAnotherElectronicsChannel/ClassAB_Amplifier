### How to design a fully discrete Class-AB Amplifier ###

Let's design a fully discrete Class-AB amplifier consisting only out of transistors and some resistors and capacitors.
I will show you how to simulate everything in LTSpice (transient, but also in AC domain to obtain correct feedback-loop stability).
If this video reaches 100 likes I will build up this circuit in real :-)
